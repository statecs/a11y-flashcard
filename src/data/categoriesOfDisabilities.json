      "question": "Thomas is a twelve year old student who is sighted but colorblind. He is having difficulty understanding a pie chart that shows the number of Mac users versus PC users in his class. He cannot correlate the values in the pie slices with the data series in the legend. In the pie chart, the Mac users are shown as the green slice, and the PC users are shown as the red slice. Identify the solutions that are most helpful to Thomas and that he is likely to use. (Select three.)",
      "options": [
        "In the slices, use patterns in addition to color",
        "In addition to the pie chart, provide a data table",

        "Label the slices with text boxes"

      "correctAnswers": [0, 1, 3],
      "explanation": "Using patterns in addition to color allows someone who is colorblind to differentiate the slices. Providing a data table that deconstructs the data visualization into its tabular format and allows a different way of accessing it. Labeling the values of each pie slice would also add a secondary means to decode the information."
