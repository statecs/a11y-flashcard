      "description": "The fundamental message is that people with disabilities are people first, who deserve the same respect as everyone else. This includes recognizing their full humanity, independence, and right to make their own decisions. The principles emphasize treating people with disabilities as individuals who live full, independent lives, work, pay taxes, get married, and participate in all aspects of society. Key points include: 1) Put people first, 2) Focus on the whole person, not attributes of their body, 3) Ask people what their needs are."

      "category": "Key Guidelines",
      "description": "These guidelines address common misconceptions and promote respectful interaction. They recognize that being blind doesn't mean being deaf, being deaf doesn't mean being blind, using a wheelchair doesn't limit someone's capabilities, and people with disabilities live full, independent lives. The overall guidance emphasizes staying relaxed and natural in interactions while respecting personal space and autonomy. Essential practices include: 1) Focus on the person, not their disability, 2) Look at the person signing, not the interpreter, 3) Ask before helping - don't assume help is needed, 4) Let the person hold your elbow for mobility assistance, 5) Don't touch assistive devices or service animals without permission, 6) Respect that service animals are working animals, 7) Recognize that people with disabilities make their own decisions."

      "category": "Language Guidelines",
      "description": "The word disability isn't pejorative, but defining someone by attributes of their body is considered demeaning. When communicating about people with disabilities, we should recognize their humanity first and use terms that they prefer. Terms like 'disability' and 'disabled' are generally preferred over 'handicap' or 'crippled'. More 'positive' labels such as 'physically challenged' and 'differently abled' may occasionally be appropriate, although many people with disabilities find such euphemisms offensively trivializing. Important guidelines include: 1) Use people-first language, 2) Avoid defining people by their disabilities, 3) Avoid euphemisms that may trivialize disabilities, 4) Only mention disability when relevant to the context."

    {
      "category": "General Interaction",
      "description": "The overall guidance is simple: treat people with disabilities the way you would want to be treated. If unsure about how to help, just ask. Stay relaxed and natural in interactions, and focus on the person first. It's important to remember that people with disabilities are individuals who make their own decisions and live independent lives. Key principles include: 1) Treat people as you would want to be treated, 2) Ask if unsure about how to help, 3) Stay relaxed and natural in interactions, 4) Focus on the person first, 5) Respect independence and decision-making."
